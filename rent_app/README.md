* * Once a Landlord logs-in, they can create and edit properties and information about tenants.  The Landlord can also communicate about possible Work Orders or complaints that the Tenant has sent through the app.  The Landlord can provide a link where tenants can log in, and change their passwords.

* Tenant Experience:
* * Tenants can log in put in workorder requests, and access personal documents.
